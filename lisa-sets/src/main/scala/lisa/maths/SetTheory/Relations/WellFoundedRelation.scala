/**
  * A relation `R` on a set `X` is called well-founded if every non-empty
  * subset `S ⊆ X` admits a `R`-minimal element.
  *
  * Well-founded relations allow one to perform (transfinite) induction on `X`:
  * to show that `P(x)` holds for all `x ∈ X`, it is sufficient to show that
  * `P(x)` follows from `P(y)` for all `y ∈ X` such that `y R x`.
  *
  * Similarly, we can construct functions by transfinite recursion over `X`, by using
  * values of the predecessors of `x` to define the function at `x`. More
  * precisely, there exists a function `G` such that for all `x ∈ X`,
  * `G(x) = F(x, G ↾ cl(x, R))` where `cl(x, R)` is the transitive closure of the
  * predecessor relation at `x`.
